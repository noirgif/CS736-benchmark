\section{Conclusion}
We measured IPC performance, both locally and remotedly. We found out that the system call has an non-negligible impact on the latency of small packets, and we discovered that pipe could actually perform lower throughput than local TCP/IP and UDP, which hints that buffer size might also be the contributing factor.
