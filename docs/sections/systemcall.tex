\section{System Calls}

Since we are measuring I/O performance, we cannot avoid doing a lot of system calls. System calls involving context switching, and trapping into the kernel, both of which might . In order to get an better idea of how these system calls take up time. We measured some trivial system calls to see if the influence is non-trivial.

In order to measure the impact of trapping, we repeatedly make system calls that do least extra work. Here, we chose \texttt{getpid} and \texttt{getuid} as our syscalls. In addition, to avoid function returns that may take up time, we directly used the inline assembly to call the \texttt{syscall} instruction. And we return the minimal result in order to eliminate the effects random events including page faults and preemptions. As the results shows, whether using the assembly \texttt{syscall} has a great effect on the time measured.
