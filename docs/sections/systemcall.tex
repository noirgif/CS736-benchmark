\section{System Calls}

Since we are measuring I/O performance, we cannot avoid doing a lot of system calls. System calls usually involve context switching, and trapping into the kernel. To get a better idea of how these system calls take up time. We measured some trivial system calls to see if the influence is actually trivial.

To measure the impact, we repeatedly make system calls that do least extra work. Here, we chose \texttt{getpid} and \texttt{getuid} as our syscalls. In addition, to avoid function returns that may take up time, we directly used the inline assembly to call the \texttt{syscall} instruction. And we return the minimum across all measurements to eliminate the effects of random events including page faults and preemptions.
