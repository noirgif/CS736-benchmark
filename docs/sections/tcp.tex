\section{TCP}
TCP uses sockets to communicate between the hosts and is used across local and remote communication. TCP uses byte-ordered reliable communication mechanism which is widely supported across today's operating systems. To measure the latency and throughput of the TCP stream sockets, packet sizes of 4, 16, 64, 256, 1K, 4K, 16K, 64K, 256K, and 512K were considered.

One of the issues encountered while measuring TCP latency was that when using the read and write function calls of the Rust language on TCP stream, the functions were reading and writing random bytes of data which were different than the expected values. This caused discrepancies in the read and write a sequence of the server and the client model. To remedy this problem, we switched to different function calls, \texttt{read\_to\_end} and \texttt{write\_all}, which helped synchronize the flow of data between the client and the server.
