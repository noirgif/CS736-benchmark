% Discuss how we measure pipe

We measured the performance of pipes in terms of latency and throughput. In order for a pipe to be used, we first create a pair of pipes, and then fork the process to let them talk to each other.

We tried to measure the impact of how the bytes written each time impacts the latency and the throughput. Since the pipe does not transmit messages in the form of a packet, we simulate it by initiating \texttt{read} and \texttt{write} each time with the desired size.

We measure the latency in terms of RTT. And repeat the experiment 100000 times to get the minimum latency as the final result. For latency, we make one process send 1GiB data, and the other process, on receiving all data, returns a message to the sender, and the time of the whole process is used to calculate the throughput. We apply the same method to the measurements on TCP/IP and UDP.
