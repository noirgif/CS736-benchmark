\begin{abstract}
    There are multiple ways to do inter-process communications(IPC). For example, processes other use pipes to communicate with each other, whereas TCP and UDP can also choices to communicate both locally and remotely. Due to their differences in design, they tend to have different latencies and througputs. Our experiments showed such difference, and that the packet size and system calls are important factors to the latency and the througput of IPC.
